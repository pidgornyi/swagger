# Swagger Codegen for GENE

## Overview
Swagger Codegen doesn't have the generator that suits Gene project right out of the box. We existing code base, so we need to generate the sources in the same way to correspond existing dependencies and introduce minimal changes )) 
This task brings us out of the scope of a configuration of existing code generation libraries and templates customization.
This project builds a library for [Swagger Codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen).

## What's Swagger?
The goal of Swaggerâ„¢ is to define a standard, language-agnostic interface to REST APIs which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of the service without access to source code, documentation, or through network traffic inspection. When properly defined via Swagger, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic. Similar to what interfaces have done for lower-level programming, Swagger removes the guesswork in calling the service.


Check out [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) for additional information about the Swagger project, including additional libraries with support for other languages and more. 

## What has been done?
* Redundant additional files, imports, annotations, loggers, docs, supp have been removed. I left only what is really used in existing code.
* Models, Interfaces, Controllers have been renamed and organized properly to replace existing sources.
* SpringFactory generation has been added.
* Models for existing code base are not consistent. Some of them have accessors but the most models doesn't. OpenAPI vendor extension `x-codegen-accessors` has been introduced in order to resolve it without rewriting of dependants.
* Option models have `com.softcomputer.wbc.security.options.OptionInfo` annotations. It was resolved with vendor extension `x-optionInfo`. See example bellow
```
      SSNMask:
        type: string
        x-optionInfo:
          valueType: string
          optionType: parameter
      
```
* Some interfaces have cache control annotation - `com.softcomputer.wbc.util.http.CacheControl`. Vendor extension `x-cache-control` has been added to ggeneration code logic.
```
tags:
    description: Setup  service
    x-cache-control: 300
```
* Enum names are not generated by default. It's internal representation and not covered by open api spec. In order to generate the sources with enum name and description the proper vendor extensions have been introduced
```
  TestStatus:
    type: string
    enum:
      - N
      - I
    x-enumNames:
      - NEW
      - IN_PROCESS
    x-enumDescription:
      - New
      - In Process
```
